/* The program is designed to solve Machine problem 3 for WCCâ€™s Intro to C class. The challenege was to read a cell phone log, and determine how many mintues the caller was charged and what the total cost is. This programs solves this problem by opening the phone log using an ifstream object. After the if stream object has been opened an ofstream object will be initialized and create a text file outputFileMP3.txt which will save the cellphone charges on a report. After the output file has been created a while loop will run until the last line of the input file has been reached. Each loop of the while loop th program will do the following. Extract data from one line of the input file. Use if and else statements to determine the cost for each phone call accoring the the phone plan's specification. Then out put the time, duration, type of call, minutes used so far, and the cost on the output file. Some important phone plan specificaions included, daytime calls are charged are 200 minutes, area calls are charged $0.29 per minute, long distance calls are charged $0.69 per minute, and daytime calls are between 6am-5:59pm. After the while loop has finshed the input and output streams will be closed*/
